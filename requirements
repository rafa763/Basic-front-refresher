Make a Table with 3 rows that contain Movie Title, Trailer link, and Publish Date.

Using Dom
Manipulation, promises, async and await, manually create a
CSV file where there are 3 Columns: Movie Name, Trailer
Link, and Publish Date. Read these values from the CSV and
use them to populate your Table that previously had dummy
Data. You should also make a button called Refresh Table
that updates the table from the CSV file in case it was
changed.
